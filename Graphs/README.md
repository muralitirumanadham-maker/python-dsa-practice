# Graphs

This folder contains Python implementations of **Graph Data Structures and Algorithms**
commonly asked in technical interviews.

The focus is on:
- Understanding graph representation
- Applying DFS on graph-based problems
- Building strong graph fundamentals step by step

---

## Concepts Covered

### Graph Basics
- Graph representation using **Adjacency List**
- Undirected graphs
- Vertex and edge operations

---

## Implementations

### 1. Graph Representation (Adjacency List)
- Undirected graph implementation
- Add vertex
- Add edge
- Remove edge
- Remove vertex
- Print graph structure

This implementation builds the foundation for all
graph traversal and problem-solving techniques.

## Grid-Based Graph Problems

### Flood Fill (DFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS) on a 2D grid
- Each cell is treated as a graph node
- 4-directional adjacency:
  - Up
  - Down
  - Left
  - Right
- Uses recursion to fill connected components
- Handles edge cases to prevent infinite recursion

## Status

🚀 **In Progress**

Graph algorithms are being added incrementally with clean,
readable, and interview-focused implementations.
