# Graphs

This folder contains Python implementations of **Graph Data Structures and Algorithms**
commonly asked in technical interviews.

The focus is on:
- Clear graph representations
- Core traversal algorithms
- Problem-solving patterns using graphs
- BFS / DFS based interview questions

---

## Concepts Covered

### Graph Basics
- Graph representation using:
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix (conceptual)
- Directed vs Undirected Graphs
- Weighted vs Unweighted Graphs

---

## Implementations

### 1. Graph Representation
- Adjacency List implementation for undirected graphs
- Supports add/remove vertex and edge operations


### 2. Breadth First Search (BFS)
- BFS traversal from a given source
- Uses Queue
- Level-order traversal concept

### 3. Depth First Search (DFS)
- DFS using recursion
- DFS using stack (iterative)

---

## Graph Traversal Patterns

- Visit tracking using `set`
- Handling disconnected graphs
- Source-based traversal

---

## Interview Problems (Planned)

- Number of Connected Components
- Detect Cycle in Graph
- Flood Fill
- Rotten Oranges (Graph BFS)
- Course Schedule (Topological Sort – later)

---

## Language Used

- Python

---

## Status

🚀 **In Progress**

Graph algorithms are being added incrementally with clean,
readable, and interview-focused implementations.
