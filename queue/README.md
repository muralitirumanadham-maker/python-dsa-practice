important interview problems related to queues.

Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where elements are
inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

---

## Implementations

1. Queue using Linked List
2. Queue using Two Stacks
3. First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream

---

## Operations Covered

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek / Front
- Is Empty
- Queue traversal
- First non-repeating character detection

---

## Key Concepts

- FIFO behavior
- Queue implementation using linked list
- Queue implementation using stacks
- Queue + HashMap combination
- Efficient stream processing

---

## Interview Value

Queue-based stream problems are commonly asked in technical interviews at
companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
