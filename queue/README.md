Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where elements are
inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

---

## Implementations

1. Queue using Linked List
2. Queue using Two Stacks

---

## Operations Covered

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek / Front
- Is Empty
- Queue traversal

---

## Key Concepts

- FIFO behavior
- Queue implementation using linked list
- Queue implementation using stacks
- Efficient O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations

---

## Interview Value

Queue implementations and design problems are commonly asked in technical
interviews at companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
