# Queue

This folder contains Python implementations of the Queue data structure and
important interview problems related to queues.

Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where elements are
inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

---

## Implementations

1. Queue using Linked List
2. Queue using Two Stacks
3. First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream
4. Reverse First K Elements of Queue
5. Time Needed to Buy Tickets
6. Gas Station Circuit

---

## Operations Covered

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek / Front
- Is Empty
- Queue traversal
- First non-repeating character detection
- Reverse first k elements in queue
- Queue simulation
- Greedy traversal for circular route

---

## Key Concepts

- FIFO behavior
- Queue implementation using linked list
- Queue implementation using stacks
- Queue + HashMap combination
- Stack + Queue interaction
- Queue simulation techniques
- Greedy decision making

## Interview Value

The problems in this folder cover the most common queue-based and traversal
patterns asked in technical interviews at companies like Amazon, Google,
and Microsoft.
