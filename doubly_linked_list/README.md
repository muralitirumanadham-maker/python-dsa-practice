# Doubly Linked List

This folder contains Python implementations of Doubly Linked List concepts.
A doubly linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions
using `next` and `prev` pointers.

## Implementations

1. Doubly Linked List Core Operations
2. Palindrome Check using Doubly Linked List
3. Reverse Doubly Linked List
4. Partition Doubly Linked List
5. Reverse Doubly Linked List Between Indices

## Operations Covered

- Append
- Prepend
- Pop
- Pop First
- Get by Index (Optimized traversal)
- Set value
- Insert at index
- Remove at index
- Forward traversal
- Palindrome check
- Reverse linked list (in-place)
- Partition list around a value
- Reverse sublist between given indices

## Key Concepts

- Bidirectional traversal
- Efficient deletion using `prev` pointer
- Optimized index-based access
- Two-pointer technique (forward & backward)
- In-place reversal
- List partitioning using dummy nodes
- Pointer manipulation (`next` and `prev`)
