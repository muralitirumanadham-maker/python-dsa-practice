# Doubly Linked List

This folder contains Python implementations of Doubly Linked List concepts.
A doubly linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions
using `next` and `prev` pointers.

## Implementations

1. Doubly Linked List Core Operations

## Operations Covered

- Append
- Prepend
- Pop
- Pop First
- Get by Index (Optimized traversal)
- Set value
- Insert at index
- Remove at index
- Forward traversal

## Key Concepts

- Bidirectional traversal
- Efficient deletion using `prev` pointer
- Optimized index-based access
- Pointer manipulation (`next` and `prev`)
