# Doubly Linked List

This folder contains Python implementations of Doubly Linked List (DLL) concepts.
A doubly linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions
using `next` and `prev` pointers, enabling efficient insertion, deletion, and
reordering operations.

## Implementations

1. Doubly Linked List Core Operations  
2. Palindrome Check using Doubly Linked List  
3. Reverse Doubly Linked List (In-place)  
4. Partition Doubly Linked List around a Value  
5. Reverse Doubly Linked List Between Indices  
6. Swap Pairs in Doubly Linked List  
7. LRU Cache using Doubly Linked List and HashMap  

## Operations Covered

- Append
- Prepend
- Pop
- Pop First
- Get by Index (Optimized traversal)
- Set value
- Insert at index
- Remove at index
- Forward traversal
- Palindrome check
- Reverse linked list (in-place)
- Partition list around a value
- Reverse sublist between given indices
- Swap adjacent nodes in pairs
- Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction

## Key Concepts

- Bidirectional traversal
- Efficient deletion using `prev` pointer
- Optimized index-based access
- Two-pointer technique (forward & backward)
- In-place reversal
- List partitioning using dummy nodes
- Pointer manipulation (`next` and `prev`)
- Combining HashMap + Doubly Linked List for O(1) operations
