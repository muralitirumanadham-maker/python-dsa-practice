# python-dsa-practice

This repository contains Python implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms
for technical interview preparation. Each topic is organized into clearly
structured folders with clean, readable, and interview-focused solutions.

The repository emphasizes strong fundamentals, problem-solving patterns,
and well-explained implementations commonly asked in product-based company
interviews.
