# python-dsa-practice

This repository contains **Python implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms**
for technical interview preparation.

Each topic is organized into separate folders with clean,
readable, and interview-focused solutions.

### 1. Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

---

### 2. Stacks
- Stack implementation
- Monotonic stack problems
- Stack-based interview questions

---

### 3. Queues
- Queue implementation
- BFS-based problems
- Simulation problems (e.g., Rotting Oranges)

---

### 4. Hash Tables
- Hash Maps
- Hash Sets
- Frequency-based problems
- Two Sum and Subarray Sum patterns
- Anagram grouping
- Set-based optimizations

---

### 5. Trees
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Tree traversals and operations

---

### 6. Graphs
- Graph representation (Adjacency List & Matrix)
- BFS and DFS traversals
- Cycle detection (Directed & Undirected)
- Topological Sort (DFS & BFS)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s Algorithm)
- Shortest Path Algorithms:
  - Bellman–Ford
  - Floyd–Warshall

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to build **strong DSA fundamentals**
and prepare for **technical interviews at product-based companies**
through consistent practice and clean implementations.
