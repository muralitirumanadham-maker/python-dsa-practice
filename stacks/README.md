# Stack

This folder contains Python implementations of the Stack data structure and
important interview problems based on stack patterns.

Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle and is widely used in
parsing, validation, monotonic stack problems, and design questions.

---

## Implementations

1. Stack using Linked List
2. Stack using List (Array)
3. Reverse String using Stack
4. Balanced Parentheses using Stack
5. Sort Stack using Another Stack
6. Min Stack (O(1) minimum retrieval)
7. Daily Temperatures (Monotonic Stack)
8. Next Greater Element II — Circular Array
9. Next Greater Element I — Stack + HashMap

---

## Operations Covered

- Push
- Pop
- Peek / Top
- Is Empty
- Size
- Stack traversal
- Reverse string using stack
- Balanced parentheses validation
- Stack sorting using auxiliary stack
- Minimum element in constant time

---

## Key Concepts

- LIFO behavior
- Stack using linked list
- Stack using array (Python list)
- Auxiliary stack usage
- Monotonic decreasing stack
- Circular traversal using modulo
- Stack + HashMap combination
- O(1) push and pop operations
- O(n) monotonic stack solutions

## Interview Value

The problems in this folder cover the most common stack patterns asked in
technical interviews at companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.
