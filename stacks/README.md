# Stack

This folder contains Python implementations of the Stack data structure and
high-value interview problems based on stack patterns.

Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle and is widely used in
validation, parsing, monotonic stack problems, and design questions.

---

## Implementations

1. Stack using Linked List
2. Stack using List (Array)
3. Reverse String using Stack
4. Balanced Parentheses using Stack
5. Sort Stack using Another Stack
6. Min Stack (O(1) minimum retrieval)
7. Daily Temperatures — Monotonic Stack
8. Next Greater Element II — Circular Array
9. Next Greater Element I — Stack + HashMap
10. Previous Smaller Element — Monotonic Stack
11. Stock Span — Monotonic Stack
12. Largest Rectangle in Histogram — Monotonic Stack
