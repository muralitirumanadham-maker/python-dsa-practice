# Hash Tables

This folder contains Python implementations of Hash Table (Hash Map) concepts
and interview-focused problems.

Hash tables store data in key-value pairs and provide efficient average-case
time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

## Implementations

1. Hash Table using Chaining
   - Custom hash function
   - Collision handling with chaining
   - Insert (set)
   - Search (get)
   - Retrieve all keys

2. Find Common Element using Hash Table
   - Brute force O(n²) approach
   - Optimized O(n) solution using hash map

3. Find Duplicate Elements
   - Detect duplicate values using hash map
   - Handles multiple repetitions efficiently

4. First Non-Repeating Character
   - Frequency-based hash map solution
   - Returns first unique character in a string

5. Group Anagrams
   - Group strings with same character frequency
   - Hash map with sorted string as key

## Key Concepts

- Hash functions
- Collision handling
- Chaining technique
- Key-value storage
- Time complexity optimization
- Space vs time trade-off
- Frequency counting
- String normalization
- Average-case O(1) lookup

---

## Interview Value

Hash table problems involving frequency counting, grouping, and optimization
are very commonly asked in technical interviews at companies like Google,
Amazon, and Microsoft.
