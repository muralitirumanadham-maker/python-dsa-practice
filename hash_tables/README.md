# Hash Tables

This folder contains Python implementations of Hash Table (Hash Map) concepts
and interview-focused problems.

Hash tables store data in key–value pairs and provide efficient average-case
time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

## Implementations

### 1. Hash Table using Chaining
- Custom hash function
- Collision handling using chaining
- Insert (set)
- Search (get)
- Retrieve all keys

### 2. Find Common Element using Hash Table
- Brute-force O(n²) approach
- Optimized O(n) solution using hash map

### 3. Find Duplicate Elements
- Detect duplicate values using hash map
- Handles multiple repetitions efficiently

### 4. First Non-Repeating Character
- Frequency-based hash map solution
- Returns first unique character in a string

### 5. Group Anagrams
- Group strings with the same character frequency
- Hash map with sorted string as key

### 6. Two Sum
- Find two indices whose values sum to a target
- Optimized O(n) solution using hash map

### 7. Subarray Sum Equals Target
- Prefix sum + hash map approach
- Handles negative numbers efficiently

## Set-Based Problems (Hash Table Applications)

- Remove duplicate elements using set
- Check if a string has all unique characters
- Find intersection of two arrays
- Find pairs with a given target sum
- Longest consecutive sequence
- Unique elements extraction

## Key Concepts

- Hash functions
- Collision handling
- Chaining technique
- Key–value storage
- Time complexity optimization
- Space vs time trade-off
- Frequency counting

## Interview Value

Hash table and set-based problems are among the most frequently asked topics
in technical interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta.
These problems focus on optimizing time complexity and efficient data lookup.
