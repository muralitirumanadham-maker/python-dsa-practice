# Hash Tables

This folder contains Python implementations of Hash Table (Hash Map) concepts
and interview-focused problems.

Hash tables store data in key-value pairs and provide efficient average-case
time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

## Implementations

1. Hash Table using Chaining
   - Custom hash function
   - Collision handling with chaining
   - Insert (set)
   - Search (get)
   - Retrieve all keys

---

## Key Concepts

- Hash functions
- Collision handling
- Chaining technique
- Key-value storage
- Average-case O(1) lookup

---

## Interview Value

Understanding how hash tables work internally is essential for technical
interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
