# Hash Tables

This folder contains Python implementations of Hash Table (Hash Map) concepts
and interview-focused problems.

Hash tables store data in key-value pairs and provide efficient average-case
time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

## Implementations

1. Hash Table using Chaining
   - Custom hash function
   - Collision handling with chaining
   - Insert (set)
   - Search (get)
   - Retrieve all keys

2. Find Common Element using Hash Table
   - Brute force O(n²) approach
   - Optimized O(n) solution using hash map

---

## Key Concepts

- Hash functions
- Collision handling
- Chaining technique
- Key-value storage
- Time complexity optimization
- Space vs time trade-off
- Average-case O(1) lookup

## Interview Value

Hash tables are one of the most important data structures in technical
interviews. Problems focusing on optimizing time complexity using hash maps
are frequently asked at companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
